                    <p>Hey there! I'm Naomi. Welcome to my page. Read below to find out a little more about me.</p>
                    <ul class="biography-description">
                    <li> Olympic Swimming</li>
                        <p>I am a Olympic Swimmer for my home country of Botswana. I swim the sprint freestyle and sprint backstroke. 
                            I have represented Botswana in competition in over 30 countries and do not plan to stop there </p>
                    <li> Film Photography</li>
                        <p> I started doing film photography as a hobby that would help me curb my anxiety. I quickly fell in love with it.
                            The ability to control virtually every single element helped me feel in control whenever other aspects of my life felt otherwise.

                    <li> Product Marketing</li>
                        <p> In 2018, I had my first true exposure to working with technological products. I'm very intrigued by the concept of using data to
                            understand your consumers and collaborate with product managers and engineers to deliver the best product.
